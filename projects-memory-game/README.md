# Memory Game Project

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" . There are  eight different pairs of cards, the cards are arranged randomly with the symbol face down. The game play rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Challenge
Match cards in less time with less moves.

## Instructions
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## How I built the Memory Game
- created the game  from the js file insted of the html file
- shuffel the cards befor the player start a new game
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of the play
- created a restart button that will start a new game for the player
- create a modal when the player wins game and print the result
